# ai-master-projects

This repository showcases selected projects and assignments completed during my **Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence** at the **Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)**.

All the work presented here was developed by me as part of the academic requirements of the program. The aim of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical applications of AI through hands-on projects across various disciplines.
