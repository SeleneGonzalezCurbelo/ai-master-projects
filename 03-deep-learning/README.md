# Deep Learning Project

This repository contains experiments on deep learning techniques, focusing on both fully connected networks and convolutional architectures.  

## Directories

1. [**Digit Classification with MLP**](digit_classification/)  
   Implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify handwritten digits using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).  
   The experiment explores data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of classification accuracy.  

2. [**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**](cnn/)  
   Development of Convolutional Neural Networks applied to the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  
   The experiments include shallow and deep CNN architectures, the use of regularization (Dropout, Batch Normalization), optimization strategies, and data augmentation for image classification tasks.
