# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

The projects focus on applying different **NLP techniques** using Python and specialized libraries such as **spaCy**, **scikit-learn**, and **transformers**.  

The main goal is to explore **text characterization** and **modern word embeddings & transformers** for text classification.

## Directories

1. [**Text Characterization**](text_characterization/)  
- **Goal**: Apply spaCy to automatically process text and detect basic linguistic and semantic features.  
- **Dataset**: *Hate speech detection corpus* (binary classification: hate vs. non-hate).  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Named-Entity Recognition (NER).  
  - Basic linguistic analysis (lemmas, gender, number).  
  - Statistical comparison of hateful vs. non-hateful comments.  
2. [**Word Embeddings & Transformers for Text Classification**](word_embeddings_transformers/)  
- **Goal**: Explore modern embeddings and transformer-based models for text classification tasks.  
- **Techniques**:
  - Word2Vec, GloVe, and contextual embeddings.  
  - Transformer architectures (BERT, DistilBERT).  
- **Applications**:
  - Text classification (hate speech detection and related tasks).  
  - Comparison between traditional ML pipelines and deep learning approaches.
